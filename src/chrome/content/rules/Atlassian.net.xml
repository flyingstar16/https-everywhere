<!-- This rule was automatically generated based on an HSTS
     preload rule in the Chromium browser.  See
     https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.h
     for the list of preloads.  Sites are added to the Chromium HSTS
     preload list on request from their administrators, so HTTPS should
     work properly everywhere on this site.
